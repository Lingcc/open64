1. Overview
=============

 Open64 is an open source, optimizing compiler for multiple architectures. 
 Open64 supports Fortran 77/95/2003 and C/C++, as well as the shared memory 
 programming model OpenMP. Open64 derives from the SGI compilers for the MIPS 
 called MIPSPro. It was released under the GNU GPL in 2000. The initial release 
 of Open64 only supports Intel IA-64(Itanium). Now it has been extended to 
 generate code for CISC, RISC, VLIW architectures, including x86, MIPS, IA-64 
 and others.

 The objective of the Osprey project is to bring the Open64 compiler
 to that of a production quality compiler and catch up with the GCC/G++
 features evolution. This release was merged with PathScale 3.2 release.
 Thanks to this PathScale release, GCC 4.2 based FE is enabled and works
 for IA64 also. We improved the performance, integrated many bug fixes 
 by leveraging efforts from PathScale, NVIDIA and SimpLight. We also
 enhanced the scalability, capability and correctness of IPA. 
 It is worth noting that several new code generators and programming 
 system are integrated into this release, including CUDA from NVIDIA,
 SL (a 32-bit multi-threaded architecture for embedded systems and DSP 
 in telecommunications) from SimpLight, MIPS (prototype) from ICT with 
 input from both PathScale and SimpLight.
 
 The source code of the latest release and all previous archives can be 
 found in the subversion tree and it is readily available for researchers 
 and developers to join the development and incrementally check in changes. 

 The website for that is 
 http://www.open64.net/

 The release consists of two kinds of packages: a suite of pre-built 
 compiler binaries including C, C++, F95 and related archives, and 
 a suite of corresponding compiler source codes. The pre-built compilers 
 are built using a self-build bootstrap process. They are provided both in
 .bz2 and RPM packages. These files can be downloaded from sourceforge.net:
 http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=34861

 After this release, we will continue to update the GCC/G++ front end to the 
 latest version, improve the quality and scalability. Another important 
 focus after this release is further performance improvement to follow the 
 latest CPU and architecture evolution, especially for the multicore. Besides 
 this, Open64 based static analysis tool, runtime optimization framework, 
 security checking tool are highly expected. 
 
 We are looking forward for collaboration from the open source community 
 for this effort. The SVN source control and Bugzilla system are built up 
 to facilitate this. Our check-in testing will be continuously improved 
 to achieve the "check-in early and check-in fast with little to no impact 
 to overall quality" development environment.

2. Features
=============

2.1 Front End Features
-------------------

 Open64 C/C++ Front End is based on GNU C/C++ Compiler (GCC). The C/C++ Front 
 End provides the compatibility with GCC from 3.x to latest 4.x. Open64 FORTRAN 
 Front End is based on CRAY-FORTRAN, which supports FORTRAN 77/95/2003 and CRAY 
 extensions. 

 In this release, we enabled the GCC 4.2.0 based FE to get better compatibility 
 with the latest GCC revision. Several bugs in previous GCC 3.3.1 and 4.0.2 
 based FE are also fixed.
 
 Now the compiler contains three different GCC based front-ends:
  o. GCC 3.3.1 based FE
    Provides the compatibility with GCC 3.x

  o. GCC 4.0.2 based FE
    Provides the compatibility with GCC 4.0.x
    
  o. GCC 4.2.0 based FE
    Provides the compatibility with GCC 4.1.x and above
  
 The right FE will be chosen automatically based on the version of the GCC 
 on the host. The command line options: '-gnu3', '-gnu40' and '-gnu42', can
 be used to designate the FE explicitly.

 We also improve the conformance of the FORTRAN Front End for new FORTRAN
 2003 features:
  o. Using 'intent' and 'pointer' attributes together
  o. 'volatile' attribute and declaration

2.2 Back End Features
-------------------

 Open64 Back End contains several optimizers and code generator.
  o. Interprocedural Analyzer and Optimizer (IPA)
  o. Loop Nest Optimizer (LNO)
  o. Global Optimizer (WOPT)

 The Code Generator (CG) can generate code for several targets, including 
 IA-64, IA-32 and x86_64 and others.

 In this release, we reduced the memory footprint of IPA to get better 
 scalability to enable building large C++ application with IPA. Also, we enhanced 
 the IPA to handle mixed archives which may contains both WHIRL IR files 
 and object files. Several bugs to build shared libraries (.so) with IPA are 
 also fixed. Besides IPA, Some bugs in LNO, WOPT and CG are fixed. 

 We also introduced several performance improvements in BE.  
  o. Better loop vectorization and loop factorization from PathScale
  o. New dead store elimination (DSE) algorithm from SimpLight
  o. Improved prefetch efficiency for ix86 and x86_64 from PathScale
  o. Improved instruction scheduling for ix86 and x86_64 from PathScale
  o. Better tuning for both AMD and Intel new multicore CPU from PathScale

 Several new targets were also supported in this release besides IA-64, x86 
 and x86_64:
  o. SL (an embedded DSP architecture) code generation from SimpLight
  o. CUDA code generation from NVIDIA
  o. A MIPS code generation prototype from ICT based on input from PathScale
     and SimpLight
 
  
3. The Packages of the Compiler Suite
=============

 This compiler is available in both binary and source-code form for
 different target machines.

 o. open64-4.2-0.src.tar.bz2
   This package contains the compiler's source code. It's machine independent.

 o. open64-4.2-0.ia64.tar.bz2
   This package contains all the binary code for ia64 machine including
   pre-built library. The compiler is built on an Itanium2 based system with
   kernel 2.6.18 and glibc 2.5. The OS is RHEL5 on IA64. The GCC version 
   is 4.1.1. The compiler is built twice for releasing. The first stage 
   is built by open64 4.1 at '-O2', then we use the compiler built in the 
   first stage to build the release compiler at '-O2'. The libraries are built 
   by the release compiler. 

 o. open64-4.2-0.i386.tar.bz2, open64-4.2-0.x86_64.tar.bz2
   These two packages are the same; contain all the binary code for i386 and 
   x86_64 machines. The compiler is built on an IA32 based system with 
   kernel 2.6.18 and glibc 2.5. The OS is RHEL5 on IA32. The compiler is 
   built twice for releasing. The first stage is built by Open64 4.1 at '-O2', 
   then we use the compiler built in the first stage to build the release 
   compiler at '-O2'. The 32-bit libraries are built on the same 
   system by this compiler. 
   The 64-bit libraries are built on an RHEL5 x86_84 system by this compiler.

 o. open64-4.2-0.i386.rpm, open64-4.2-0.x86_64.rpm, open64-4.2-0.ia64.rpm    
   These three packages are binaries rpm for different targets. The binaries 
   are the same in both bz2 and rpm packages. It's easier to install the 
   compiler from the rpm.

4. Installing the Compiler Suite
=============

4.1 Install from bz2 Package
-------------------

 Before installing the compiler, the environment variable $TOOLROOT
 should be set properly. As the name suggests, this variable specifies
 the root of the installation hierarchy. You can set it to anywhere
 you have write permission. For example, in GNU BASH this may be done
 with the following command: may set this variable by adding this
 command to the $HOME/.bash_profile file:

   export TOOLROOT=$HOME/mycompiler

 After that, run 'source $HOME/.bash_profile' to make the change effective.
 Now, to complete the installation:

 o. Expand open64-4.2-0-ia64.tar.gz with the command:

    tar zxvf open64-4.2-0-ia64.tar.gz

 o. Run script 'INSTALL.sh'

 The C, C++, FORTRAN compilers are now available in folder
 $TOOLROOT/bin. They are opencc, openCC, openf90 respectively.
 
4.2 Install from RPM Package
-------------------

 To install the compiler from rpm:

 $ rpm -ivh open64-4.2-0.ia64.rpm

 This command will install the Open64 compiler to /opt/open64. The C, C++, 
 FORTRAN compilers are in folder /opt/open64/bin.

 To install the compiler to another location:

 $ rpm --prefix=/path/to/folder -ivh open64-4.2-0.ia64.rpm

 Then the compiler will be installed to /path/to/folder

5. Build the compiler Suite - directly from source
=============

 If you choose to build the compiler suite from the source tar ball,
 follow the steps outlined below.

5.1 Prerequisites
-------------------

 In order to compile Open64 successfully, your system should meet the
 following requirements:

 o. Linux OS on IA64/ix86/x86_64

   Open64 as well as its variants have been successfully built on many UNIX
   variants and UNIX-like systems. This release has only been tested extensively
   on IA64/ix86/x86_64 running Linux operating systems. If you are going to
   build it on any platform other than Linux on IA64/ix86/x86_64, you may need 
   to make some minor changes to the source code.

 o. Miscellaneous Tools
   
   To build the open64 compiler from source, these tools are needed:
  
   awk, csh, bash, gmake, flex and bison
   
   On some Ubuntu distributions, you need to set the environment variable 
   'SHELL' to '/bin/bash' or change the symbol link '/bin/sh' to '/bin/bash' 
   to make the shell scripts work.
 
 o. GNU Compiler Collection

   Currently, GCC 3.3.x through 4.1.x are supported. GCC 4.1.x is preferred.

 o. An open64 binary for building the FORTRAN Front End

   You can just download the Open64 binary for system and install it to 
   some place and make sure that openf90 is in your PATH before building 
   the FORTRAN Front End. 
   
   Intel Fortran Compiler (on IA64/IA-32/x86_64) or PathScale Fortran Compiler
   (on IA-32/x86_64) can also be used to build the FORTRAN Front End.

5.2 Build Steps
-------------------

  Follow these steps to build the compiler:

 Step 1. Expand the source tarball

   After that, the whole source hierarchy will be in directory rooted at
   open64-4.2-0/. Change working directory to open64-4.2-0/.

 Step 2. Build the compiler components by simply invoking command:

     make or make V=1(V=1 will show all building information)

   If you want to build a debuggable compiler, use this command instead:

     make BUILD_OPTIMIZE=DEBUG

   Note that, if you type "make", it will only build the compiler's source 
   code by default it won't build the necessary libraries. If you want to 
   build them by yourself, type 

     make library

   The default FORTRAN compiler in source code is openf90. If the openf90 is 
   not in the PATH, the FORTRAN front end will not be built. During the 
   installation, the pre-built version will be picked up. Then, we can use
   it to build the FORTRAN front end again. 

   Developers may find this command handy in building individual component,     
   say wopt.so:

     make BUILD_OPTIMIZE=DEBUG wopt.so 

 step 3. Set environment variable TOOLROOT to anywhere you have write
  permission as detailed in section 3. 
  If you do not want to use $TOOLROOT, just skip this step.

 step 4. Call 'make install' or 'install_compiler.sh' to install
  all compiler components and archives.
  If $TOOLROOT is set, the compiler will be installed to that folder. 
  Otherwise, a path will be prompted.

  The C, C++, FORTRAN compilers are now available in folder

  $TOOLROOT/bin/ 
  
  They are opencc, openCC, openf90 respectively.

  People interested in building the compiler for CUDA or SL should contact 
  NVIDIA or SimpLight directly. 


5.3 Build FORTRAN Front-End
-------------------

 The FORTRAN front-end executable is provided in both binary and source 
 packages. Normally, you need *NOT* to build it by yourself. If you are 
 going to build one, make sure that an Openf90 is already in your $PATH
 (you need to download a binary form and install it somewhere).

 Then just type:

   make mfef95.

 The Makefile will use a pre-hand openf90 to build the new mfef95 for you.

5.4 Build the archives
-------------------

  The archives required by Open64 are provided in both binary and source 
  packages. Normally, you need *NOT* to build it by yourself. These libraries
  can be built by Open64. Add $TOOLROOT/bin into your $PATH and type:
 
   make BUILD_COMPILER=OSP lib
   
  Then, you can follow the step 3 and step 4 in section 5.2 to install these
  archives.

5.5 Some Notes on Build
-------------------

 o. The compiler is built with flag '-Werror' which treats warnings as error.
  If the build process terminates due to warnings, you can get around this
  with:

      make ... ERROR_ON_WARNINGS="" ...

  i.e. simply repeat the make process with ERROR_ON_WARNINGS="".


6. Bug Reporting
=============

   You are WELCOME to report bugs. The bugs tracked at
   
   http://bugs.open64.net/. 
   
   Bug reports should include these items in order to be reproduced:

 o. The compiler release version;

 o. System details -- the OS, libc etc;

 o. The compilation flags that trigger the bug;

 o. The test file if applicable (it is highly appreciated if the test file
   is minimized);

 o. The correct output of the test file.

7. Known Problems, Limitation and Some Notes
=============

 o. Currently, we built the compiler *ONLY* on Linux/IA64, x86_64, i386.
  'make cross' is supposed to be used to build the cross compiler on
  Linux/IA32 systems targeting IA64. However, we have not tested this 
  thoroughly.

 o. On x86_64, Open64 can be built in either 32-bit or 64-bit. We find 
  several bugs in building 32-bit applications by 64-bit compiler. All 
  executables in Open64 4.2 binary release on x86_64 are 32-bit. These bugs 
  will be fixed in the next release.

 o. Auto-Parallel Optimization (enabled by '-apo') has been implemented in the 
  compiler. But now it does not work. We will fix this problem in the next 
  release.

 o. The perlbench benchmark in CPU2006 suite may not run successfully without
  some changes to its source code on IA-64. It is *NOT* an Open64 bug. 
  The problem is with the perlbench benchmark itself. Please check the bug-81
  (https://bugs.open64.net/) for details. This problem can be solved by
  deleting following lines from file spec_config.h (of perlbench benchmark):

     1172 #undef HASATTRIBUTE
     1173 #ifndef HASATTRIBUTE
     1174 #define __attribute__(_arg_)
     1175 #endif

 o. A full list of known bugs can be found in our bug database. You can visit

  http://bugs.open64.net

  to view them.
