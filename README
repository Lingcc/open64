README
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The Open64 compiler suite includes optimizing compilers and runtime
support for C, C++ and FORTRAN 77/90/95. These compilers produce code
that follows the corresponding ABI on IA-32/Linux, x86_64/Linux and
IA-64/Linux and be compatible with the latest GCC revesion. This means
that objects produced by the Open64 compilers can link with objects
produced by other ABI compliant compilers.

The latest information and updates for the Open64 compilers will
eventually be found at http://www.open64.net. The latest code in 
development can be obtained via SVN at http://svn.open64.net. 
The downloadable packages of sources or binaries can be found at
http://www.sf.net/projects/open64.

Please send problem reports to the mailing list described to the
BugZilla system at https://bugs.open64.net

Language highlights:

  C compatible with gcc, with gcc extensions
  C++ compatible g++, with g++ extensions
  FORTRAN 77/90/95 support

Optimization highlights:

  Platform-independent optimizations:
  Code Motion
  Constant propagation
  Dead code elimination
  Expression simplification
  Common subexpression elimination
  Strength reduction
  Partial redundency elimination
  Loop optimizations, enabled at '-O3'
  Interprocedural analysis and optimization, enabled with '-ipa'

  Platform-dependent optimizations:
  Software pipelining on IA-64
  Control and Data speculation on IA-64
  Integrated instruction scheduling with resource management

Other features

  OpenMP support in C/C++/Fortran

Upcoming features
  Advanced data prefetch
  New alias analysis framework
  New interprocedural analysis and optimization framework
  More optimizations


Installation Information

  The Open64 compiler is available in both binary and source-code form
on IA32/x86_64/IA-64. For more details about how to install compiler from
binary package or source, please refer HOWTO-INSTALL-OPEN64 and the
RELEASE.
