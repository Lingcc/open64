/*
 * Test rationale:
 *
 * Just as normal mmap()s can't have an address, length or offset
 * which is not page aligned, so hugepage mmap()s can't have an
 * address, length or offset with is not hugepage aligned.
 *
 * However, from time to time when the various mmap() /
 * get_unmapped_area() paths are updated, somebody misses one of the
 * necessary checks for the hugepage paths.  This testcase ensures
 * that attempted hugepage mappings with parameters which are not
 * correctly hugepage aligned are rejected.
