/* Test rationale:
 *
 * ppc64 kernels (prior to 2.6.15-rc5) have a bug in the hugepage SLB
 * flushing path.  After opening new hugetlb areas, we update the
 * masks in the thread_struct, copy to the PACA, then do slbies on
 * each CPU.  The trouble is we only copy to the PACA on the CPU where
 * we're opening the segments, which can leave a stale copy in the
 * PACAs on other CPUs.
 *
 * This can be triggered either with multiple threads sharing the mm,
 * or with a single thread which is migrated from one CPU, to another
 * (where the mapping occurs), then back again (where we touch the
 * stale SLB).  We use the second method in this test, since it's
 * easier to force (using sched_setaffinity).  However it relies on a
 * close-to-idle system, if any process other than a kernel thread
 * runs on the first CPU between runs of the test process, the SLB
 * will be flushed and we won't trigger the bug, hence the
 * PASS_INCONCLUSIVE().  Obviously, this test won't work on a 1-cpu
 * system (should get CONFIG() on the sched_setaffinity()).
