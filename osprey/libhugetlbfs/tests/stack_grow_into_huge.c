/*
 * Test rationale:
 *
 * On PowerPC, the address space is divided into segments.  These segments can
 * contain either huge pages or normal pages, but not both.  All segments are
 * initially set up to map normal pages.  When a huge page mapping is created
 * within a set of empty segments, they are "enabled" for huge pages at that
 * time.  Once enabled for huge pages, they can not be used again for normal
 * pages for the remaining lifetime of the process.
 *
 * If the segment immediately preceeding the segment containing the stack is
 * converted to huge pages and the stack is made to grow into the this
 * preceeding segment, some kernels may attempt to map normal pages into the
 * huge page-only segment -- resulting in bugs.
 *
 * The kernel bug in question was fixed by commit
 * 0d59a01bc461bbab4017ff449b8401151ef44cf6.
