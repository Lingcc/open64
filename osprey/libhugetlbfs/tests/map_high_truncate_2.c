/*
 * Test rationale:
 *
 * At one stage, a misconversion of hugetlb_vmtruncate_list to a
 * prio_tree meant that on 32-bit machines, certain combinations of
 * mapping and truncations could truncate incorrect pages, or
 * overwrite pmds from other VMAs, triggering BUG_ON()s or other
 * wierdness.
 *
 * Test adapted to the libhugetlbfs framework from an example by
 * Kenneth Chen <kenneth.w.chen@intel.com>
 *
 * WARNING: The offsets and addresses used within are specifically
 * calculated to trigger the bug as it existed.  Don't mess with them
 * unless you *really* know what you're doing.
 *
 * The kernel bug in question was fixed with commit
 * 856fc29505556cf263f3dcda2533cf3766c14ab6.
