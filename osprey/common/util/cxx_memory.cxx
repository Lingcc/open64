/* Description of new scheme:
 * ==========================
 *
 * Many C++ implementations don't support calling destructors for 
 * array objects allocated using placement new (which we need since we
 * want to allocate memory from the memory pools rather than malloc).
 * In fact, I believe the language is either ambiguous about this, or
 * explicitly does not support this.
 *
 * We need to mangle new/delete to call MEM_POOL_Alloc and MEM_POOL_FREE
 * instead of malloc and free. 
 *
 * We used to do this using placement new/delete in which we would pass in 
 * extra arguments to new/delete (e.g. mempool) and then have them allocate
 * memory from the right place. To make sure that constructors/destructors 
 * for arrays of objects allocated using placement new were called correctly,
 * Shankar et al had a hack using hash tables to maintain the number of
 * elements and call the destructors correctly. This hack was invoked using
 * -Wf,-Yv to the 5.3 compilers.
 *
 * This hack is gone in Mongoose. We therefore use the following scheme:
 * - instead of using placement new, we communicate with new using global
 *   variables instead of parameters. As a result the standard C++ 
 *   implementation automatically counts the number of array elements, and
 *   calls the constructor/destructor the correct number of times.
 * - we define the CXX_NEW and CXX_NEW_ARRAY macros to set the global
 *   _dummy_new_mempool variable, and the new operator to MEM_POOL_Alloc 
 *   memory from this memory pool. Since CXX_NEW must be an expression, we
 *   cannot have a scope within which to save the incoming value of this dummy,
 *   and therefore there is a likelihood of this variable being overwritten
 *   before it is used. Therefore the new operator resets this dummy to be -1
 *   so that when the actual new comes around, it's value is gone, leading to
 *   a compiler-runtime error. Thus CXX_NEWs cannot be nested.
 *   Note that the last value in the expressions must be the return value
 *   of the new operator, to have the types in the assignment x = CXX_NEW(...)
 *   work out OK.
 * - we define the CXX_DELETE and CXX_DELETE_ARRAY macros to set the global
 *   value of dummy_delete_mempool, which is used by the operator delete
 *   to MEM_POOL_FREE the memory appropriately. Since CXX_DELETE is a 
 *   statement and not an expression, it can have a scope and save the 
 *   incoming value in a stack variable. So CXX_DELETEs can be nested.
 * - the final issue is to make sure that no one ever calls the original 
 *   new/delete operators -- this is arranged by exporting the new and delete
 *   operators (__nw__FUi and __dl__FPv) in be/be/Exported. This overrides
 *   calls to new and delete in libC from __vec_new, __vec_delete, etc.
 *
 *
 *
 * ABANDONED SCHEME:
 * =================
 *
 * I experimented with another scheme in which I explicitly maintained the
 * number of elements of an array in 8 extra bytes of storage before the 
 * pointer for all arrays. This scheme was abandoned since the above works 
 * better, but here are some lessons learnt. The scheme was:
 * - try always using placement new, with the argument to new being the storage
 *   allocated from MEM_POOL_Alloc. E.g.
 *    #define CXX_NEW(type, pool) new (MEM_POOL_Alloc(sizeof(type), pool)) type
 *   But this doesn't work since "type" might have arguments to the constructor
 * - so then we pass the memory pool as an argument to a placement new 
 *   operator that takes arguments.
 *    #define CXX_NEW(constructor, mempool)  (new (mempool) constructor)
 * - for arrays there are no arguments to constructors, so we allocate
 *   8 extra bytes, store the number of elements, and then call the above
 *   new to allocate an array. Since it's placement new, the compiler does
 *   nothing for arrays.
 * - for CXX_DELETE is easy - the operator delete is defined to do NOTHING.
 *   the macro first calls the destructor, then calls MEM_POOL_FREE to free
 *   the storage.
 * - for CXX_DELETE_ARRAY there is a loop -- look for the number of elements,
 *   call the destructor for each element of the array, and then call 
 *   MEM_POOL_FREE.
 * 
 * This scheme mostly worked. The problem came because the expansion of the
 * CXX_DELETE and CXX_DELETE_ARRAY macros contained the "pointer" argument
 * multiple times, and would therefore evaluate it repeatedly. So code like:
 *      while (stack.Elements ())
 *          CXX_DELETE (stack.Pop ());  // or delete_array
 * did not work, since the stack.Pop would happen more than once, lots of
 * times.
 * The fix for this was to change the macro definition to also pass the 
 * type in for the delete macros (at least for CXX_DELETE_ARRAY), but 
 * thankfully we found the solution that we now use. Inline functions did
 * not work since we need a variable of the type being deleted, and we would
 * need an inline function for each type that we want to delete.
 * 
 * The code for this abandoned scheme is in Rohit's workarea, in
 * /hosts/snowy.mti/work/workarea/v7.00/common/util/cxx_memory.{h,cxx}.shank
