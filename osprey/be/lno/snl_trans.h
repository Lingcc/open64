/**
*** Description:
***
*** This file contains functions and classes for the transformation of
*** simply nested loops.  Code specific to general transformation is 
*** given in snl_gen.cxx, while code specific to invariant transformation
*** is given in snl_inv.cxx. 
***
*** The actual transformation theory is discussed in doc/Mongoose
*** /snl-transformation.mif.
***
*** The assumption is that access vectors are up to date upon entry to
*** SNL processing.  I do not keep them up-to-date during the SNL
*** transformation process, because while they are very useful for me to
*** gather the information I need, the information I gather is actually
*** tailored to my needs (SNL_NEST_INFO and SNL_TRANS_INDEX_DATA).
*** But the access vectors are used by SNL_NEST_INFO().
***
*** For loop distribution, a dependence test is supplied, and it's noted
*** where distribution would have to occur to make things legal.  Then, if
*** is a transformation is applied that can benefit by distribution, then
*** distribution is applied at that point.
***
*** UPDATING DU/UD INFORMATION:
***
*** For invariant nests:
***
***     -- interchange involves no changes.
***     -- cache tiling involves making new variables for tile indices,
***        and using them only in bounds further in.  Also, the bounds
***        for the tile index loops themselves.  But all the information
***        is right there.
***     -- regtiling is fine, since as long as everything is up-to-date
***        before, then the copy routines do the right thing.
***
*** For general nests:
***
***     -- Protect_Nest_With_Conditionals: easy, since this only involves
***        defs for the variables in the bounds information.
***     -- U_Ctiling() uses SNL_TRANS_INDEX_DATA, which is augmented
***        to include the defs for each index variable.  So as long as
***        that data structure is passed around when doing copies, no
***        problem.
***     -- General_2D_Regtile.  Again as long as things are up-to-date
***        before this code, no problem.
***
*** TODO: The Fix_Do_Du_Info() is a hack.  Isn't there some better way to
*** update index variable du chains?  Can't I let them all rot and recompute
*** them at the end (they're easy)?  This might be too slow.  It's not well
*** thought out about what the minimal number of calls to it would be.
***
