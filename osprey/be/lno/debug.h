/**
*** Description:
***
***   This file contains information about the Whirl Browser, which can be 
***   used to interactively debug programs while running the LNO Phase.  
***
***   To invoke the whirl browser from dbx, type "p debug()".  You can get 
***   a list of available options by typing 'H' at the prompt "WB>". 
***
***  Exported functions: 
***
***   void WB_OMP_Initialize(WN* global_fd, INT sanity_check_level)
***
***	Initializes the whirl browser to operated on the program unit 
***     'global_fd' and sets the 'sanity_check_level'. 
***
***   void WB_OMP_Terminate();
***
***     Makes the whirl browser inoperative. 
***
***   void WB_Set_Sanity_Check_Level(INT sanity_check_level) 
***	
***	Set the sanity check level to value 'sanity_check_level'. 
***	The following are valid values: 
***	  WBC_DISABLE => Disable sanity checking 
***	  WBC_DU_ONLY => Do DU sanity checking only 
***	  WBC_DU_AND_ARRAY => Check DU and array dependences 
***	  WBC_FULL_SNL => Do Full SNL sanity checking 
***	Sanity checking is invoked by using the 'C' command. 
***   
***   const char* WB_Whirl_Symbol(WN* wn, BOOL print_type=FALSE)
***
***	 A printable string of characters for whirl node 'wn'. For 
***	 loads and stores, the symbol is printed, if any.  For do loops,
***	 the symbol of the do loop is printed.  
***
***   extern BOOL WB_Dep_Symbol(WN* wn, char buffer[], INT max_string)
***
***	 Write an abbreviated version of node 'wn' to the first 
***	 'max_string' characters of 'buffer'.
