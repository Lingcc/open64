 * Module: w2f_driver.h
 * $Revision: 1.1 $
 * $Date: 2005/07/27 02:13:42 $
 * $Author: kevinlo $
 * $Source: /depot/CVSROOT/javi/src/sw/cmplr/be/whirl2f/w2f_driver.h,v $
 *
 * Description:
 *
 * W2F_Should_Emit_Nested_PUs()
 *    Returns TRUE when we should translate nested PUs.
 *
 * W2F_Process_Command_Line()
 *    Process the command line arguments. Evaluate flags pertaining
 *    solely to w2f, assuming these are in the phase_argv list, 
 *    ignoring all others (assuming non-w2f options are processed 
 *    and checked for correctness elsewhere).  argv[0] is assumed to
 *    hold the name of the current program invocation ("whirl2f")
 *    or NULL if there is no such name.  Also, set up the file-names 
 *    (W2F_File) such that these are all non-NULL.  The naming of 
 *    files is based partially on the command-line options, and 
 *    partially on Src_File_Name and Irb_File_Name.  The only 
 *    W2F_File which may be NULL after this call is the W2F_LOC_FILE.
 *
 * W2F_Init()
 *    Basic Initialization of W2F, assuming the command-line has 
 *    already been processed and the global symbol-table, string-
 *    table, and initialization table already have been read in with 
 *    Read_Global_Info().  This initiates all translation modules, 
 *    but opens no output files and does no preliminary translation.
 *
 * W2F_Push_PU()
 *    Must be called before translating an expression within
 *    a PU (i.e. a FUNC_ENTRY).  The new symbol table for the 
 *    given PU will be pushed onto the stack.  After this call, the
 *    locally defined symbol names can be accessed by means of the 
 *    W2CF_Symtab_Nameof_() routines.  This call
 *    also specifies the subtree within the body of the pu, which
 *    we are interested in translating, which *must* exactly match
 *    the subtree passed in a call to W2F_Translate_Wn() or 
 *    W2F_Translate_Wn_Str().
 *
 * W2F_Pop_PU()
 *    This must be called after a PU is done with, and the symbol
 *    table-section for the PU will be popped off the whirl2f
 *    symbol table stack.
 *
 * W2F_Set_Prompf_Emission()
 *    Pass in a mapping from WN nodes to construct identifiers, and
 *    notify whirl2f to emit its output in a form suitable for ProMPF.
 *    Call this one time only, before any translation takes place!
 *
 * W2F_Set_Frequency_Map()
 *    Pass in a mapping from WN nodes to feedback frequency information.
 *    Call this for each PU that has such a map.  The actual emission
 *    of this info (in comments) is controlled by the "emit_frequency"
 *    -FLIST option.
 *
 * W2F_Get_Transformed_Src_Path()
 *    Returns the name of the .f file emitted by whirl2f.  Must be
 *    called after W2F_Init().
 *
 * W2F_Def_ST()
 *    Appends a definition for the given symbol to the given
 *    file.  The file must be open with write permission.
 *
 * W2F_Object_Name()
 *    Returns the name of the given function.
 *
 * W2F_Translate_Stid_Lhs()
 *    Given the attributes for an OPR_STID (or similar attributes
 *    derived from other kinds of nodes, such as an OPR_LDID), put an
 *    expression suitable as an assignment lhs in the given string
 *    buffer.
 *
 * W2F_Translate_Istore_Lhs()
 *    Same as W2F_Translate_Stid_Lhs(), but based on the attributes
 *    for an OPR_ISTORE instead of the attributes of an OPR_STID.
 *
 * W2F_Translate_Wn()
 *    Translation of an arbitrary WN tree into Fortran, assuming the 
 *    current PU scope has been pushed onto the whirl2f symbol-
 *    table stack.  The output will be appended to the given file.
 *    If the expression is a FUNC_ENTRY node, then the local symbol
 *    table will be pushed and popped, and the effect is similar 
 *    to W2F_Outfile_Translate_Pu().  The file must be open with 
 *    write permission. 
 *
 * W2F_Translate_Wn_Str()
 *    Same as W2F_Translate_Wn(), but the output is put into the
 *    given string buffer instead of being appended to a file.
 *
 * W2F_Fini()
 *    Finalization of W2F.  This will terminate all translation 
 *    modules and free up their state information (such as symol-
 *    tables, etc).
 *
 *                  EXPORTED OUTPUT-FILE INTERFACE
 *                  ------------------------------
 *
 * This is the easiest interface for using whirl2f, and it
 * maintains output file status and produces a uniform output
 * format based on the -FLIST options.  There are strict rules
 * as to how this interface interacts with the lower-level 
 * interface described above.
 *
 * W2F_Outfile_Init()
 *    Initializes the output-files for whirl2f, based on the
 *    command-line options.  Will call W2F_Init() is this has
 *    not already been done.  Optionally, the file-level 
 *    declarations may be emitted to the generated header file.
 *
 * W2F_Outfile_Translate_Pu()
 *    Translates a PU, presupposing W2F_Outfile_Init() has been 
 *    called.  The PU will be lowered (for Fortran) and the 
 *    output Fortran code will be appended to the output files.
 *
 * W2C_Output_Fini()
 *    Finalizes a W2F translation by closing the output-files, and
 *    calling W2F_Fini().  Call this before the Irb file is closed!
 *
 *        INTERACTION BETWEEN OUTPUT-FILE AND LOW-LEVEL INTERFACE
 *        -------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * 1) There is no ordering constraint between the Init routines.
 *    A redundant call to an init routine is simply ignored.
 *
 * 2) All "Outfile" routines require a W2F_Outfile_Init() call.
 *
 * 3) All "low-level" routines require a W2F_Init() or a 
 *    W2F_Outfile_Init() call.
 *
 * 4) A call to W2F_Push_PU() may be followed by a call to 
 *    W2F_Outfile_Translate_Pu(), in which case the scope will 
 *    not be pushed again and will not be popped when
 *    W2F_Outfile_Translate_Pu() returns.
 *
 * 5) W2F_Fini() has no effect if W2F_Outfile_Init() was called,
 *    since finalization must then be done with a call to
 *    W2F_Output_Fini().
 *
 * 6) Initialization may again occur after a finalization for
 *    a another whirl2f translation.  Two whirl2f translation
 *    tasks cannot be active simultaneously within the same process,
 *    but the same WHIRL tree may be translated multiple times
 *    in a given sequential sequence by the same translation 
 *    process.
