     *  Description: 
     *  ============
     * 
     *  This module serves as handshake between scheduler and speculation-
     *  package src/osprey1.0/be/cg/orc_intel/{speculation.*,recovery.*}
     * 
     *  We centralize all workarounds to spec-package here to prevent it     
     *  from scattering anywhere in scheduling phase.  
     *
