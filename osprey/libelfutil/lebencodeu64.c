    This routine encodes the given unsigned number in leb128 mode,

    of bytes in the encoding.  It is the user's responsibility to
    make sure there is enough storage at buffer.  The details of
    leb128 encoding are in the Dwarf document.

    buffer must have 10 bytes of storage to take care of the worst case.
