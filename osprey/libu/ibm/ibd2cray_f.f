      INTEGER FUNCTION
     +IBD2CRAY@(TYPE, NUM, FORN, BITOFF, CRAY, STRIDE, CRAYCH)

C     The IBD2CRAY@ function converts IBM Fortran data types to CRAY
C     Fortran data types.  The REAL and DOUBLE PRECISION data
C     representations are both 64 bits.
C
C     The returned function value is as follows:
C
C         <0  Parameter error; no translation performed
C          0  Translation complete; no errors
C         >0  Translation complete; return value is the number of
C             values that completely overflowed or completely under-
C             flowed.
