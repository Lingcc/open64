      INTEGER FUNCTION
     +CRAY2IBD@(TYPE, NUM, FORN, BITOFF, CRAY, STRIDE, CRAYCH)

C     The CRAY2IBD@ function converts CRAY Fortran data types to IBM 32-bit 
C     data types.   The REAL and DOUBLE PRECISION data representations
C     are both 64 bits.   This function is a close variant of CRAY2IBM.
C
C     The returned function value is as follows:
C
C         <0  Parameter error; no translation performed
C          0  Translation complete; no errors
C         >0  Translation complete; there were values that completely 
C	      overflowed or completely under-flowed.
