/*
 * _IEEE_REMAINDER_R_R(X,Y) - calculate remainder of two real(8)
 *                            arguments.
 *
 *              The standard definition for real is:
 *                 If y = 0, remainder(x,y) = NaN and raise the INVALID
 *                           exception.
 *                 else if x = INFINITY, remainder(x,y) = NaN and raise
 *                           the INVALID exception.
 *                 else remainder(x,y) = x - (REAL(NINT(x/y))) * y
 *
 *              The algorithm for real is:
 *                x - (REAL(NINT(x/y))) * y.
 *
 * Use the following algorithm for x/y rounded quantity:
 *   1.  x/y
 *   2. if(fraction(x/y) = .5 exactly, round to next EVEN number.
 *           0.5 = 0.0, 1.5 + 2.0, 10.5 = 10, etc.
 * Use the following algorithm for the multiply:
 *   ((((x - tdivU *yU) - tdivU * yL) -tdivL * yU) - tdivL * yL)
 *
