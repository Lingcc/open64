/*
 *	The CRI2IEG_77 subroutine converts Fortran data types on a system
 *	using IEEE (T3D) floating-point representation to a system
 *	using generic 32 bit IEEE floating point representation.
 *
 *	Call from Fortran:
 *
 *	INTEGER CRI2IEG_77
 *
 *	IERR = CRI2IEG_77(TYPE, NUM, FORN, BITOFF, NATIVE, STRIDE, [, NATIVECH])
 *
 *	The returned function value (IERR) is as follows:
 *
 *		-2	Parameter error; invalid TYPE
 *		-3	Parameter error; invalid NUM
 *		-4	Parameter error; invalid BITOFF
 *		-7	Unable to malloc() memory for translation
 *		 0	Translation complete; no errors
 *		>0	Translation complete; return value is the
 *			number of values that overflowed during
 *			translation.
 *
 *	TYPE
 *
 *								Size in Bits
 *
 *								CRI	IEG
 *		  0 = typeless (no translation).		64	64
 *		  1 = integer (64 bit)				64	32
 *		  2 = real (64 bit)				64	32
 *		  3 = double precision 	<deferred>		128	64
 *		  4 = complex 					2x64	2x32
 *		  5 = logical					64	32
 *		  6 = character (ASCII to ASCII; no conversion) 8	8
 *		  7 = short integer 				64	16
 *		  8 = special real 				64	64
 *
 *
 *	NUM
 *
 *		Number of data items to convert.  Type integer variable,
 *		expression, or constant.
 *
 *	FORN
 *
 *		T3D systems:  	Variable or array of any type (except CHARACTER)
 *				or length to receive the converted 32 bit IEEE 
 *				data.
 *
 *		This variable contains the target Cray MPP systems array or 
 *		32 bit IEEE systems array to received the converted data, 
 *		whichever is not native to the running system.
 *
 *	BITOFF
 *
 *		Bit offset within FORN to begin the conversion.  Type
 *		integer variable, expression, or constant.  Bits are
 *		numbered from 0, beginning at the leftmost bit of FORN.
 *
 *	NATIVE
 *
 *		T3D systems:  	Variable or array containing the values to be
 *				converted if type is not CHARACTER.
 *
 *		This variable contains the target Cray MPP systems array or 
 *		32 bit IEEE systems data to be converted,  whichever is
 *		native to the running system, for noncharacter types.
 *
 *		This variable should be of a type corresponding to the
 *		TYPE parameter.  This array is strided in accordance with
 *		the STRIDE argument.
 *
 *	STRIDE
 *
 *		Integer parameter specifying a memory increment for
 *		storing the conversion results in IEC, in units of
 *		internal storage length.  The input bits are taken from
 *		FORN regardless of this parameter in a continuous bit
 *		stream.  For two- or four-word items, this is a stride
 *		of items, NOT of words.
 *
 *	NATIVECH
 *
 *		T3D systems:  	Variable or array containing the values to be
 *				converted if type is CHARACTER.
 *
 *		Optional variable contains the target Cray MPP systems array or 
 *		32 bit IEEE systems data to be converted,  whichever is
 *		native to the running system, for CHARACTER types.
 *
 *		This parameter is ignored and may be omitted if type is not
 *		CHARACTER.
