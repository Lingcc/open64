      INTEGER FUNCTION
     +CRAY2IED@(TYPE, NUM, FORN, BITOFF, CRAY, STRIDE, CRAYCH)

C     The CRAY2IED@ function converts CRAY Fortran data types to a
C     generic 32-bit platform with IEEE floating-point representation
C     data types.   The REAL and DOUBLE PRECISION data representations
C     are both 64 bits.   This function is a close variant of CRAY2IEG.
C
C     The returned function value is as follows:
C
C         <0  Parameter error; no translation performed
C          0  Translation complete; no errors
C         >0  Translation complete; return value is the number of
C             values that completely overflowed or completely under-
C             flowed.
