      subroutine orders (mode,iwork,data,index,n,ireclth,
     1                   ikeylth,iradsiz)
c
c     orders is an internal, fixed-length record sort routine
c
c
c     entry:
c
c     mode     indicates type of sort to be performed:
c
c           0, keys are treated as positive (unsigned) integers
c              over the range [0..(2**64)-1].
c           1, keys are treated as  two's  complement  (signed)
c              integers over the range [-2**63..(2**63)-1].  in
c              fortran:  type integer.
c           2, keys are treated as floating-point numbers.   in
c              fortran:  type real.
c          10, same as mode = 0, but the array  index  has  the
c              initial ordering of the records.
c          11, same as mode = 1, but the array  index  has  the
c              initial ordering of the records.
c          12, same as mode = 2, but the array  index  has  the
c              initial ordering of the records.
c
c     iwork     user-supplied working storage array.   iwork  should
c          be  dimensioned  to  2**(8*iradsiz)  (256 or 65,536)
c          words).  in fortran:
c
c                dimension iwork (256)             if iradsiz=1
c                dimension iwork (65536)           if iradsiz=2
c
c     data      array containing n records of length  ireclth  each.
c          in fortran:
c
c                dimension data (ireclth, n)       - or -
c                dimension data (n)                if ireclth=1
c
c     index     if mode is greater than or equal to 10,  then  index
c          contains  the initial ordering of the records in the
c          array data.  thus, data(i,index(1)) is the ith  word
c          of  the first record and data(i,index(n)) is the ith
c          word of the last record.  each index(i) should be in
c          the  closed  interval [1..n] and unique with respect
c          to all other index(i).  in fortran:
c
c                dimension index (n)
c
c     n         number of records to be sorted.
c
c     ireclth   length of each record in words.  the default is one.
c          the key begins in the first word of each record.
c
c     ikeylth   length of each key in eight-bit bytes.  the  default
c          is eight bytes (one word).
c
c     iradsiz   radix of the sort (number of eight-bit  bytes  which
c          are  to  be  processed  per pass).  the default (and
c          and minimum) is one byte; the maximum is two  bytes.
c          if  the radix is two and the key length is odd, then
c          the first pass is done with a radix of one.
c
c     exit:
c
c     mode      less than zero if error, else unchanged.
c
c     index     sorted, such that for i := 1 to n-1:
c
c          data (key,index (i))) is less than or equal to
c          data (key,index (i+1)))
c
c          the radix pocket sort is stable (i.e., the order  of
c          records with identical keys is preserved).
c
c     error codes:
c
c          -1 = too few arguments (less than five)
c          -2 = too many arguments (greater than eight)
c          -3 = invalid ireclth (less than one)
c          -4 = ikeylth greater than ireclth
c          -5 = invalid iradsiz (not one or two)
c          -6 = invalid ikeylth (less than one)
c          -7 = invalid n (less than one)
c          -8 = invalid mode (not in [0..2,10..12])
c          -9 = mismatched mode  and  ikeylth  (must  be  eight  for
c          floating-point or signed integer sort)
c         -10 = iradsiz greater than ikeylth
c
c     steps:
c
c            1) validate arguments.
c
c            2) if no initial ordering is supplied, then  initialize
c          index(i) to i.
c
c            3) signed integer and floating point  keys  are  trans-
c          formed  by  a  one-to-one  order-preserving  mapping
c          which allows them to be treated as unsigned  integer
c          keys.  this step, if done, is undone in step 5.
c
c            4) for each radix pass (ikeylth div iradsiz) do steps a
c          through  e  (note that keys are processed from least
c          significant radix to most significant radix):
c
c          a) clear iwork array by setting iwork (i) to 0.
c
c          b) for each key, data (i), count the  occurances  of
c             each  radix  (an  8-  or 16-bit slice of the key)
c             into iwork.  upon completion of this  step,  each
c             iwork  (i)  contains  the  number  of keys with a
c             radix of i.
c
c          c) cascade iwork array by setting  each  element  to
c             the sum of all previous elements.  when completed
c             with this step, iwork (i) contains  the  relative
c             position for the first key of radix i.
c
c          d) for each key, data (index  (i)),  compute  a  new
c             index by incrementing iwork (i) and using that as
c             offset into the index array.  that index  element
c             gets  the  new pointer to data (index (i)) in the
c             upper 32 bits.  upon  completion  of  this  step,
c             each index element contains two pointers: the old
c             pointer in the lower 32 bits and the new  pointer
c             in the upper 32 bits.
c
c          e) set new indices by shifting index (i) right by 32
c             bit positions.
c
c            5) transform keys back  to  their  original  values  if
c          necessary.
c
c     each pass of this algorithm executes in order (n) time,  where
c     n is number of elements to be sorted.  the number of passes is
c     the key length divided by the radix size (ikeylth div iradsiz)
c     so  the  overall work function is linear with respect to n, or
c     in other words, order (n).
c
c     radix sorting is described in "the art of computer programming
c     volume 3:  sorting and searching" by donald e. knuth. pp. 170-
c     178.

c\Revision history:
c     11/04/89:  Put modification in per SPR 34551.

c                if (ireclth*64.lt.8*ikeylth) then
c
c                to
c                if (ireclth*64.lt.8*ikeylthl) then
c
*
*     01/28/93   Eliminate the check for maximum memory size.  Now if
*                mode=-7 is returned, this means that N is less than
*                1.  If mode=-3 is returned, this means that IRECLTH
*                is less than 1.  Also changes the internal
*                documentation accordingly.
*                Fixes SPR #52723.
