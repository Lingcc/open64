************************************************************************
*
* Purpose:   Determine whether all values are true in source along
*            dimension dim. This routine handles source arrays of
*            rank 2. It returns an array result. This routine is
*            called by the Fortran routine ALL_I_LS2@.
*
* Arguments: result  - logical array of rank 1.
*            source  - logical array of rank 2.
*            dim     - integer scalar: dimension to search along.
*            rext    - integer scalar: extents of the result array.
*            sext    - integer array of rank 1:
*                      local extents of the source array.
*            blkcnt - integer scalar:
*                      number of blocks for dimension 2 of the source
*                      array if dim = 1 else the number of blocks for
*                      dimension 1.
*            npes    - integer scalar:
*                      number of PEs in dimension dim.
*            hi      - integer array of rank 1:
*                      the high index for each distributed block in
*                      the source array for dimension 2 if dim = 1 else
*                      the number of blocks in dimension 1.
*            low     - integer array of rank 1:
*                      the low index for each distributed block in each
*                      dimension except for dimension dim.
*            lmext   - integer scalar:
*                      extent of the local_all array if called within
*                      a parallel region, else it is the same as rext.
*            dist_cnt- the number of dimensions that are distributed over
*                      more than one processor between dimension 1 and
*                      dimension dim.
*
* Variables: local_all - logical array of rank 1: array of local all
*                      values.
*            length  - integer scalar: length of block subgroups for
*                      global update of result array.
*            offset  - integer scalar: offset into result array when
*                      (blkcnt < npes) or offset into local_all when
*                      (blkcnt > npes).
*            j_offset - integer scalar: offset within a block when
*                      (blkcnt < npes).
*            pe_offset - integer scalar: offset for each processor used
*                      when computing offset.
*            j_block - integer scalar: used to compute next block during
*                      the global update.
