/*
 *	Compiler generated call: CALL _ALL_LP6(RESULT, SOURCE, DIM)
 *
 *	Purpose: Determine whether all values are true in SOURCE along
 *	         dimension DIM. This particular routine handles
 *		 of source arrays of rank 6.
 *
 *	Arguments:
 *	        SOURCE - Dope vector for logical source array
 *	        DIM    - Dimension to operate along
 *
 *      Description:
 *		This is the MPP version of ALL. This particular
 *		file contains the the intermediate type-specific
 *		routines. These routines parse and update the dope
 *		vectors, allocate either shared or private space for
 *		the result temporary, and possibly update the shared
 *		data desriptor (sdd) for the result temporary. Once
 *		this set-up work is complete, a Fortran subroutine
 *		is called which uses features from the Fortran
 *		Programming Model to distribute the work across all
 *		processors.
 *
 *		Include file all_p.h contains the rank independent
 *		source code for this routine.
