CDIR$ ID "@(#) libfi/mpp_reduce/count_i_p4@.f	92.0	10/08/98 14:37:14"
************************************************************************
*
* Purpose:   Count the number of true values in array source along
*            diminsion dim. This routine handles source arrays of
*            rank 4. It returns an array result. This routine is
*            called by the C routine _COUNT_LP4.
*
* Arguments: result  - integer array of rank 3.
*            source  - logical array of rank 4.
*            dim     - integer scalar: dimension to search along.
*            rext    - integer array of rank 1:
*                      extents of the result array.
*            sext    - integer array of rank 1:
*                      extents of the source array.
*            blkcnts - integer array: number of blocks for each dimension.
*            dim_bcnt- integer scalar: number of blocks in the first
*                      dimension if dim != 1 or the number of blocks in
*                      the second dimension if dim = 1.
*
* Variables: npes    - integer scalar:
*                      If dim = 1, then npes = number of PEs in the
*                      first dimension, else the number of PEs in
*                      the second dimension.
*            hix     - integer array of rank 1: the high index for each
*                      distributed block in each dimension.
*            lowx    - integer array of rank 1: the low index for each
*                      distributed block in each dimension.
*            hi_rx   - integer array of rank 1: the high index for each
*                      distributed block in each dimension of the result
*                      array.
*            low_rx  - integer array of rank 1: the low index for each
*                      distributed block in each dimension of the result
*                      array.
*            lmext   - integer array of rank 1:
*                      extents of the local-cnt array if called within
*                      a parallel region, else it is the same as rext.
*            loc_sext- integer array of rank 1:
*                      local extents for the source array.
*            dist_cnt- the number of dimensions that are distributed over
*                      more than one processor between dimension 1 and
*                      dimension dim.

*            my_pe()
