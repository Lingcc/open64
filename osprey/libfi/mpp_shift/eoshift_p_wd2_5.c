/*
 *	Compiler generated call:
 *		CALL _EOSHIFT_CP5(RESULT, SOURCE, SHIFT, BOUNDARY, DIM)
 *
 *	Purpose: Perform an end-off shift of the SOURCE array along the DIM
 *		 dimension.  The magnitude of the shift is found in SHIFT.
 *		 The value to be shifted in is contained in BOUNDARY
 *
 *	Arguments:
 *		RESULT   - Dope vector for result temporary array
 *		SOURCE   - Dope vector for user source array
 *		SHIFT    - Dope vector for shift count
 *		BOUNDARY - Dope vector for boundary (optional)
 *		DIM	 - Dimension along which to shift (optional)
 *
 *	Description:
 *		This is the MPP version of EOSHIFT.  This particular file
 *		contains the intermediate routines.  These routines parse
 *		and update the dope vectors, allocate either shared or
 *		private space for the result temporary, and possibly update
 *		the shared data descriptor (sdd) for the result temporary.
 *		Once this set-up work is complete, a Fortran subroutine is
 *		called which uses features from the Fortran Programming
 *		Model to perform the actual shift.
 *
 *		Include file eoshift_p.h contains the rank independent
 *		source code for this routine.
