/*
 *	Compiler generated call: CALL _SCANMAX_SS2(RES, SRC, STOP, DIM, MASK)
 *
 *	Purpose: Determine the maximum value of the elements of SRC
 *	         along dimension DIM corresponding to the true elements
 *               of MASK. This particular routine handles source arrays
 *	         of rank 2 with a data type of 64-bit floating point.
 *
 *	Arguments:
 *	        RES    - Dope vector for temporary result array
 *		SRC    - Dope vector for user source array
 *		STOP   - Dope vector for stop array
 *              DIM    - Dimension to operate along
 *	        MASK   - Dope vector for logical mask array
 *
 *	Description:
 *		This is the MPP single PE version of SCANMAX. This
 *	        routine checks the scope of the source and mask
 *	        arrays and if they are private, calls the current
 *	        Y-MP single processor version of the routine. If they
 *	        are shared, then it allocates a result array before
 *	        calling a Fortran routine which declares the source
 *	        and mask arguments to be UNKNOWN SHARED.
 *
 *		Include file segmented_scan_s.h contains the rank independent
 *		source code for this routine.
