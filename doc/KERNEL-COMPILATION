I. Introduction
------------------------------------------------
This document explains the status of open64 linux kernel compilation.
Tested platform: x86/IA64/PowerPC32

II.  The scripts
------------------------------------------------
We use a shell scripts file to handle options for kernel compilation.
It locates in osprey/targtarget_target[-nodebug]/driver/

Scripts file kdriver mainly does these things:
1)ignores these options onlyfor GCC and do not pass them to opencc.
  For options such as omit_frame-pointer that gcc uses for kernel
  compilation, but are not relavant to osprey. So we must ignore them.
2)Create and pass correct options such as -OPT:spec=off and -OPT:swp=off
  for osprey.

First, it gets all the gcc options for kernel compilation (We do not
need to modify kernel's makefile). Then it adds essential ospry options
and ignores some options only supported by gcc. Builds and passes
correct options to osprey for kernel compilation.

I'd like to add it as a seperate file. It is just for kernel building.
For other application, we still use the origional driver.

III. Kernel compilation
------------------------------------------------
When we build kernel, we use it like this:

  make CC=kopencc (kopencc=kdriver, just a symbol link)

then, it will help us to reorgnize the options.
That's the way we use it now.

X86 Example:
Tested platform: ubuntu linux 8.10/X86 with local 
gcc 4.2.4/g++4.1.3/Binutils 2.18.93.
1) download and uncompress linux kernel package (version 2.6.27.7/9)
2) make i386_defconfig
3) make CC=kopencc

Good luck and enjoy it.

IV. Known problems
------------------------------------------------
We still need a patch for kernel compilation for IA64 and PPC32.
