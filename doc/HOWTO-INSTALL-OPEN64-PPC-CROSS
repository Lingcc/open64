Installing Open64 X86-PPC cross compiler
===================================================================================================

In file HOWTO-INSTALL-OPEN64, you can find the detailed information on how to
build and install open64 compiler. However, there are a few differences you should
notice when building open64 x86-ppc cross compiler. 
In short, first you configure the source file in you build directory like this:

	<path-to-open64-dir>/open64/configure --target=powerpc-unknown-linux-gnu \
	--prefix=/usr/local/open64-cross/
	
the --target tells how to build this compiler, here we build a x86-ppc cross compiler,
so we set the target in this way: powerpc-*-linux*. And --prefix tells where to install
it after building, if you don't specify it, the default dir is /usr/local/, After that, 

	make all
	
Now that it's built, you can install the compiler, 
	
	make install
	
This will install the libraries and binaries for open64 into the directory you have set 
by --prefix. Here, you may need root permission, so you may need to add a "sudo" 
before you install, like

	sudo make install

Now the cross compiler is now successfully installed in your machine. 



You may need to add this path to your $PATH, which is to add a line in 
file /etc/profile.

	export PATH=/opt/open64/open64-cross/bin:$PATH

After a restart, you can use the cross compiler by command like

	powercc -S helloworld.c
